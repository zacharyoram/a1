<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Zachary Oram<br>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal is to improve sales and make a substancial difference to the overall success of the business CossiePlay.  By adding a website to there business profile, CossiePlay will be able to advertise and communicate with their clientele with ease.  CossiePlay will get more sales and will proceed to become a bigger and better business with the help of this website. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The site’s success will be evaluated by the specifications the client has presented to me, more specifically increased attendance to parties and to maximise costume orders. The website should use most if not all of the content the client has given me and then it will be processed into a small functional website.  when the goals have been achieved, the website is a success.  Not only is the site functional and attractive, the client should be able to maintain the website,  as it is relatively easy to update.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for this website is frequent party-goers and online enthusiasts as this will engage a large portion of the market.  In order to do this, the site will include  images and information about the upcoming social events and costume customisation. </p>
